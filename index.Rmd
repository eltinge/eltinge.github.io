I'm a data scientist interested in applying my computational skills to real-world public and behavioral health problems. I'm particularly invested in:

1) Exploring the potential for data science to improve behavioral health research and outcomes

2) Using GIS to understand the interplay between geography and health, with a social justice lens.

I currently work at Johnson and Johnson's recently opened [Healthcare Technology Center](http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20170914/in-providences-jewelry-district-glimpse-of-ris-future-tech-economy) in Providence, RI; however, all work on this website and my personal Github are my own unless otherwise noted. I intend this site to be a space for public documentation of my personal projects. If you have any feedback or ideas for potential collaborations, feel free to reach out via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/saraheltinge) or [Github](https://github.com/eltinge).
